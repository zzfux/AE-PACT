Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused.

This represents about 38.5% of the total average of 16.2 cycles between issuing two instructions. A high number of warps waiting at a barrier is commonly caused by diverging code paths before a barrier that causes some warps to wait a long time until other warps reach the synchronization point. Whenever possible try to divide up the work into blocks of uniform workloads. Use the Source View's sampling columns to identify which barrier instruction causes the most stalls and optimize the code executed before that synchronization point first."
