This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 0.99 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction. Try to increase the number of active warps by increasing occupancy and/or avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp."

This represents about 30.1% of the total average of 2.9 cycles between issuing two instructions. Typically, this stall reason should be very low and only shows up as a top contributor in already highly optimized kernels. If possible, try to further increase the number of active warps to hide the corresponding instruction latencies."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 112 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."
