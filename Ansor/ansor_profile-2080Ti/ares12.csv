This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 8 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 1.00 active warps per scheduler, which already limits the scheduler to less than a warp per instruction. Try to increase the number of active warps by increasing occupancy and/or avoid possible load imbalances due to highly different execution durations per warp."

This kernel launch is configured to execute 49 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance. This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads()."
