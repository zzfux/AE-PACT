It executes 32-bit floating point (FADD, FMUL, FMAD, ...) and integer (IMUL, IMAD) operations. The pipeline is well-utilized and might become a bottleneck if more work is added. See the Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-decoder) or hover over the pipeline name to understand the workloads handled by each pipeline. The Instruction Statistics section shows the mix of executed instructions in this kernel. Check the Warp State Statistics section for which reasons cause warps to stall."
