It executes 32-bit floating point (FADD, FMUL, FMAD, ...) and integer (IMUL, IMAD) operations. The pipeline is well-utilized and might become a bottleneck if more work is added. See the Kernel Profiling Guide (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-decoder) or hover over the pipeline name to understand the workloads handled by each pipeline. The Instruction Statistics section shows the mix of executed instructions in this kernel. Check the Warp State Statistics section for which reasons cause warps to stall."

This might leave hardware resources underutilized and may lead to less optimal performance. Out of the maximum of 16 warps per scheduler, this kernel allocates an average of 5.37 active warps per scheduler, but only an average of 1.93 warps were eligible per cycle. Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections."

The number of blocks in a wave depends on the number of multiprocessors and the theoretical occupancy of the kernel. This kernel launch results in 1 full waves and a partial wave of 35 thread blocks. Under the assumption of a uniform execution duration of all thread blocks, the partial wave may account for up to 50.0% of the total kernel runtime with a lower occupancy of 26.3%. Try launching a grid with no partial wave. The overall impact of this tail effect also lessens with the number of full waves executed for a grid. See the Hardware Model (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-hw-model) description for more details on launch configurations."
