This kernel launch is configured to execute 112 threads per block. Consequently, some threads in a warp are masked off and those hardware resources are unused. Try changing the number of threads per block to be a multiple of 32 threads. Between 128 and 256 threads per block is a good initial range for experimentation. Use smaller thread blocks rather than one large thread block per multiprocessor if latency affects performance.  This is particularly beneficial to kernels that frequently call __syncthreads(). See the Hardware Model (https://docs.nvidia.com/nsight-compute/ProfilingGuide/index.html#metrics-hw-model) description for more details on launch configurations."
