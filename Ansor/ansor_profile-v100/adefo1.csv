Eligible warps are the subset of active warps that are ready to issue their next instruction. Every cycle with no eligible warp results in no instruction being issued and the issue slot remains unused. To increase the number of eligible warps, reduce the time the active warps are stalled by inspecting the top stall reasons on the Warp State Statistics and Source Counters sections."
